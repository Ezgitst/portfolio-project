        <p class="info_text">Hello, my name is Ezgi! I am 22 years old and I am from Turkey.
            But I think it might be more informative, if I introduce myself as an enthusiastic computer engineer;
            who have received her bachelor degree from the 
            <a href="http://cs.hacettepe.edu.tr/" target="_blank">
                Department of Computer Engineering of Hacettepe University 
            </a>

        <p class="info_text">I always think that learning is a lifelong process; and on the light of this idea, I 
            always give high importance to online learning platforms; which I think as number one plaftorms as they
            are independent from time and location. So, my acquitance with 
            <a href="https://www.udacity.com/" target="_blank">Udacity</a>
            happened like that. I have discovered Udacity while I was searching for nice online lectures. And just
            a short time after my discovery, I have seen that Udacity is one of the best.

        <h3>In addition to this educational and academical info, I would also like to talk about my hobbies.</h3>
        <img class="hobby_img" src="img/basketball.png" alt="Basketball">
        <img class="hobby_img" src="img/swimming.png" alt="Swimming">
        <p class="hobby_text">First of all, doing sports is one my favourite activity. Because, I see sports as a method of relief or 
            more specifically a way of coping with stress. And especially, playing basketball and swimming are my 
            favourites.
        </p>
        <img class="hobby_img" src="img/reading.png" alt="Reading">
        <p class="hobby_text">In addition to sports, my next favourite activity is reading. While I am reading, I find myself inside the
            magical world of the book and feel relaxed just as I feel while doing sports.
        </p>
        <img class="hobby_img" src="img/coding.png" alt="Coding">
        <p class="hobby_text">And finally, like the rest of the computer engineers, coding is my best hobby :)</p>
